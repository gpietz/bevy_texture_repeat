# Repeated Textures in Bevy

This project is an attempt to display a sprite with a repeated texture using the Bevy framework in Rust. The main objective is to seamlessly repeat a texture across a sprite, creating the effect of a continuous pattern.
Until now I didn't find a solution and all I got was a stretched texture. 

## Getting Started
* Ensure you have the latest version of [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and Cargo installed on your system.
* Familiarity with the [Bevy framework](https://bevyengine.org/) is recommended.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git https://github.com/gpietz/bevy_texture_demo.git
cd bevy_texture_demo
```
2. Build and run the project:
```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```
## Current State
As of now, the project is not successfully repeating the texture on the sprite. It's possible that the approach taken might not be the best way to achieve the desired outcome with Bevy.
## How to contribute
If you have experience with Bevy or have insights on how to correctly implement texture repetition on sprites, your contributions are highly welcomed!
1. Fork the project.
2. Create your feature branch (**\`git checkout -b feature/RepeatedTexture\`**).
3. Commit your changes (**\`git commit -m 'Realize repeating texture\'**).
4. Push to the branch (**\`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature\`**).
5. Open a pull request.
